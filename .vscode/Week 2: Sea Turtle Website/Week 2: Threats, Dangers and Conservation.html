            <li>Sea Turtle meat is a delicacy in some countries, especially the Green Turtle.  This is consumed in places like Russia, China, Poland and Turkey.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Illegal trade in turtle shell, meat and eggs is causing Sea Turtles to be an endagered species. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Each year 6 million tons of rubbish enters the oceans 90% of which is plastics.  Sea Turtles can confuse floating plastics for Jellyfish and try to consume the plastic which then is caught in their digestive system.  <br> They also can get caught in the plastics in the sea and die becasue they can't escape.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Climate change is changing ocean currents which affects the Sea Turtle's ability to travel long distances.  <span> The warming the temperature of the ocean and causing sea levels to rise. This sea level rise causes less beach area and therefore there are less places for the Sea Turtle to nest. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Sea Turtles are often accidentally caught in fishing nets when fisherman are trying to catch commerical fish for sale. </li>
