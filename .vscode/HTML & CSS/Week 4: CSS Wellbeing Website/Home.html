            <h2><strong>What Is Mental Wellbeing?</strong></h2>   
                <p>
                    Mental wellbeing is often used to describe our current mental state <br>
                    and how well we feel we are coping with everday life and stress. <br>
                    Good mental wellbing means we are able to cope better when faced <br> 
                    with conflict or distressing events.  
                <br>
                <p>
                    Intense traumatic events at any stage of life can affect our <br> 
                    mental wellbeing, for example times of intense grief at the loss <br> 
                    of a loved one or a serious or frightening accident on the road or elsewhere.  <br>
                </p>    
                <span><img src="images for Wellbeing/Wellbeing 5 things.png" width="500" alt="logo"></a></span>
                <p>
                    Our mental wellbeing can be impacted when at school especially, <br>
                    when as a child we have not yet developed the necessary skills to deal <br>
                    with conflict or stress and this can then have an impact on future relationships <br>
                    and how we treat ourselves and others. <br>
                </p>  
                <p>
                    There are of course ways to improve our mental wellbeing and recently <br> 
                    there has been more in the media highlighting mental health issues <br> 
                    and workplaces have started to embrace a wellbeing programmes, <br>
                    giving employees options and help on how to deal with worries, stress, <br> 
                    grief or any other issues that may be interefering with everyday life. <br>
                    This has led to charities like <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk">Mind</a> more of a voice in the community. <br>

                <p>
                    When people are more aware of their mental state day to day, <br>
                    they then can learn techniques to overcome adversity. <br>
